Grab the entire directory and run any of the following 
* simugate.py  -  main program for designing gates 
* exercises.ff_exercise.py  -  create a flip flop using only the parts provided
* exercises.ttl_exercise.py  -  create a gate using transistors

You need Python to be installed. Python3 works. (with tkinter, which typically is normally bundled with Python)
